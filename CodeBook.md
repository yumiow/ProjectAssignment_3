This Code Book for Project Assignment 3

Backgroud: there are 6 activities when using a smartphone across 30 volunteers for this project. Multiple data/measurements about 
volunteers' movements are described in this data set.
This code book illustrates data set, data cleaning, data processing, exporting process to generate a tidy data set.

Data structure:

In train folder:
X_train.txt: 7352 rows, 561 variables (training data uses 21 out of 30 observations)

Y_train.txt: 7352 rows, 1 variables.

subject_train.txt: 7352 rows. 

X_test.txt: 2947 rows, 561 variables (9 out of 30 observations)

Y_test.txt: 2947 rows, 1 variables.

subject_test.txt: 2947 rows. 

features.txt: 561 variable names.

activity_labels.txt: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activity types from smartphone uses.



To understand the processing, please refer to the ReadMe.md. The R script would also explain ReadMe.md in more details.
